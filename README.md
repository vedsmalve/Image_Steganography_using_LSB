# Image Steganography using LSB

This desktop application allows you to hide and extract data within images using Image Steganography. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting cover images, secret images, setting AES keys, and performing the steganography operations.

## Features

- Two tabs: "Hide Data" and "Extract Data"
- Upload cover image and secret image
- Set AES 128-bit password for encryption
- Perform image steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm
- Save the steganographic result
- Extract hidden data from stego images

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the Image Steganography App on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image_steganography_using_lsb.git

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd image_steganography_using_lsb

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python main.py


## Usage
To Hide Data:
    
1. Open the application.
2. Navigate to the "Hide Data" tab.
3. Select a cover image and a secret image.
4. Set a 16-character AES key.
5. Click the "Hide Data" button.
6. Save the stego image at the prompted location

    
To Extract Data:

1. Navigate to the "Extract Data" tab.
2. Select the stego image.
3. Enter the same AES key used for hiding.
4. Click the "Extract Data" button.

        Note: "The extracted image will be saved in the 'Downloads' folder."
